# PAIMOS AEON

The next generation of Paimos: an agents-first, voice-first, multi-tenant work platform in the INSPR family. Hybrid human work stays first-class: a fully dynamic work tree, list, search and a Markdown sidebar viewer.

Status: under construction (release R0). Live at <https://aeon.barta.cm> once R0 ships. Decisions: PPM project AEON, ADR-001 (foundation) and ADR-002 (stack: Go, Postgres 18 + pgvector, Vue 3).

## Develop

```sh
just db-up        # Postgres 18 + pgvector on :55432 (Docker)
just test         # Go tests
just web-check    # web typecheck and build
just dev          # run the server (API on :8080); `cd web && npm run dev` for the UI
```

Versioning: INSPR Calendar Versioning v2 (`inspr-calendar-v2`, `YYMMDDhhmmss.0.0`); the version display uses the pinned INSPR presentation bundle, checked by `just release-check`.

## UI shell (P0.5 / AEON-10)

The Vue shell includes an authenticated workspace, sign-in, a 404, an account
menu, and light/dark themes. The theme follows the operating system until the
user toggles it; that choice lasts for the current page session and writes no
browser storage. Assets and fonts are served locally. The supplied mark is
preserved at `web/src/assets/brand/aeon-mark.svg` for its later replacement.

The auth adapter is isolated in `web/src/lib/api.ts`. Pending P0.3 contract
confirmation, it expects `/api/me` to return
`{ principal: { id, name, email? }, tenant: { id, name }, dev_mode?: boolean }`.
A 401 clears identity and routes to sign-in. Development email sign-in is
hidden unless the server explicitly returns `dev_mode: true` (including on its
401 response). It never relies on Vite's development mode. Login navigates to
`/api/auth/login`; development login posts `{ email }` to `/api/auth/dev-login`;
sign-out posts to `/api/auth/logout` before routing to `/signin`. API calls use
same-origin credentials, a ten-second timeout, and no browser response cache.
The backend owns authentication cookies and the INSPR authentication redirect.
No analytics, third-party runtime assets, or optional device storage are added.

Both version surfaces use the unchanged, verified calendar bundle in Pretty
mode with brand gold. The shared helper provides reveal and copy interactions;
`dev` remains plain text. Every production web build verifies the bundle pin.

```sh
cd web
npm run test:unit
npx playwright install chromium
npm test
```

The Playwright suite starts Vite on port 5175, intercepts all `/api/*` calls,
and covers sign-in, auth errors, logout, theme switching, version interactions,
44 px targets, and viewport overflow. It writes home, sign-in, development
sign-in, and 404 screenshots in both themes at 1280×720 and 390×844 to
`/tmp/aeon-p05-shots/`. Screenshots and browser test output are not committed.
