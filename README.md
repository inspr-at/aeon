# PAIMOS AEON

The next generation of Paimos: an agents-first, voice-first, multi-tenant work platform in the INSPR family. Hybrid human work stays first-class: a fully dynamic work tree, list, search and a Markdown sidebar viewer.

Status: under construction (release R0). Live at <https://aeon.barta.cm> once R0 ships. Decisions: PPM project AEON, ADR-001 (foundation) and ADR-002 (stack: Go, Postgres 18 + pgvector, Vue 3).

## Develop

```sh
just db-up        # Postgres 18 + pgvector on :55432 (Docker)
just test         # Go tests
just web-check    # web typecheck and build
just dev          # run the server (API on :8080); `cd web && npm run dev` for the UI
```

Versioning: INSPR Calendar Versioning v2 (`inspr-calendar-v2`, `YYMMDDhhmmss.0.0`); the version display uses the pinned INSPR presentation bundle, checked by `just release-check`.
